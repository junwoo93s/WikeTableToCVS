# WikeTableToCVS
This is toy project that I worked with Minhee Seo for data scraping.


The main purpose of this code is to converting Wikipedia table to cvs with Python. 
This code will transfer table format of data from the Wikipedia to excel file. 


1. Download the Beautilful Soup file first 
    type this on your command line
    
    
    apt-get install python-bs4
    
    
    if this doesn't work 
    try this code
    
    
    easy_install beautifulsoup4
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    
    
    
    
    if this doesn't work either
    go to this link
    https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/download/4.0/
    to download the file and 
    
    
    python setup.py install
    
    
    Now you are good to go. 
    Read comments carefully to use this code efficently.
